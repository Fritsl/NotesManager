Checkpoint 1: Simplify Your Data Saving Logic
What to Do:

Adopt a Two-Step Update Process:

In-Memory Update: Immediately update the UI by changing the local state.

Database Persistence: After the local update, asynchronously persist the changes to the database.

Reduce Complexity: Eliminate redundant or overlapping save operations that might conflict across platforms.

Self-Test:

Test Case: Modify a data point (e.g., edit a note) and observe that the UI updates instantly.

Verification: Check that after a short delay (e.g., via a console log or UI notification), the change is successfully persisted to the database.

Checkpoint 2: Implement Robust Auto-Save Mechanisms
What to Do:

Inactivity-Based Auto-Save: Set up a timer (e.g., 5 seconds) that triggers saving when no user activity is detected.

Blur-Based Saving: Detect when an input field loses focus and trigger a save operation.

Manual Save Option: Allow users to trigger saves explicitly with clear feedback.

Self-Test:

Test Case 1: Type in the app, stop interacting for 5 seconds, and check that an auto-save is triggered.

Test Case 2: Click away from an input field and verify that the save operation is executed.

Verification: Use debugging logs or UI messages (e.g., toast notifications) to confirm that saves occur as expected.

Checkpoint 3: Optimize API Communication
What to Do:

Dedicated Endpoints: Use specialized API endpoints for saving and retrieving project data.

Transaction-Style Updates: Bundle related updates together in transactions to avoid partial or conflicting saves.

Error Handling: Implement robust error detection and recovery strategies (e.g., retry mechanisms).

Self-Test:

Test Case: Simulate rapid consecutive updates (from different platforms if possible) and ensure that the API correctly processes them without conflicts.

Verification: Monitor network requests and server logs to confirm that endpoints are handling data accurately and transactions are completing successfully.

Checkpoint 4: Ensure Data Integrity and Consistency
What to Do:

Data Sanitization: Normalize and clean data before saving to ensure consistency (e.g., reassign positions for list items).

Maintain Order: Use functions to sort and reassign positions so that the hierarchical order remains intact.

Self-Test:

Test Case: Introduce unsorted or slightly corrupted data, trigger the save operation, and verify that the data is stored in the correct, clean format.

Verification: Retrieve the data and confirm that all elements are ordered as expected and that no inconsistencies remain.

Checkpoint 5: Synchronize UI and Database State
What to Do:

Source of Truth: Treat the database as the authoritative source.

Custom Events: Dispatch custom events to notify all UI components when the database has been updated.

UI Refresh: Ensure the UI listens for these events and refreshes accordingly.

Self-Test:

Test Case: Update a project property (e.g., project name) from a backend change and dispatch a custom event.

Verification: Confirm that all UI components immediately reflect the change, even if they are on different screens or platforms.

Checkpoint 6: Provide Real-Time User Feedback
What to Do:

Notification Mechanisms: Implement toast messages or similar UI feedback elements to notify users of save successes or failures.

User Confidence: Clear, immediate feedback helps users trust that their changes are saved.

Self-Test:

Test Case: Trigger a manual save and observe the notification system.

Verification: Ensure the correct message is displayed (e.g., “Project Saved” with details) and that it matches the actual state of the project.

Checkpoint 7: Implement Background Synchronization
What to Do:

Service Worker Integration: Use a service worker to handle background sync of pending operations, especially important for offline scenarios.

Queue and Process: Queue operations when offline and process them automatically when connectivity is restored.

Self-Test:

Test Case: Simulate an offline scenario by disconnecting your network, make changes, then reconnect and observe the background sync.

Verification: Confirm that all pending changes are synchronized with the database once the connection is re-established.
