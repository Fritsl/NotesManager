 there are a few key areas to investigate:

Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:

The error "new row violates row-level security policy" indicates the user doesn't have permission to insert rows into the note_images table
Check if proper RLS policies exist for:
The storage.objects table (for file uploads)
The note_images table (for image metadata)
Storage Bucket Configuration:

Verify the storage bucket exists and is properly configured
Check if the bucket has proper public/private settings
Ensure RLS policies are set up for the bucket
User Authentication:

The 403 Unauthorized error suggests authentication issues
Verify the user is properly authenticated
Check if the auth token is being passed correctly
Ensure the user has the 'authenticated' role
Required Policies:
Looking at this project's setup, you need these key policies:


-- For storage.objects
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'note-images'
  AND (LOWER(storage.extension(name)) = 'jpg' OR LOWER(storage.extension(name)) = 'jpeg' OR LOWER(storage.extension(name)) = 'png')
);

-- For note_images table
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own note images"
ON note_images FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM notes
    WHERE notes.id = note_images.note_id
    AND notes.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
Database Schema:

Verify the note_images table exists and has the correct structure
Check foreign key relationships are properly set up
Ensure the notes table exists and has proper RLS policies
To debug this:

Check if RLS is enabled: SELECT relname, relrowsecurity FROM pg_class WHERE relname IN ('note_images', 'objects');
View existing policies: SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('note_images', 'objects');
Verify storage bucket exists: SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'note-images';
Check user authentication state in the application
Review the network requests to see the exact payload being sent
The most common cause of this error is missing or incorrect RLS policies, so I'd start there.
