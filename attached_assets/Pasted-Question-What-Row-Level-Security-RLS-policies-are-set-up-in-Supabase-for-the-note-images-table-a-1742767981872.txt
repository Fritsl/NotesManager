Question:
What Row Level Security (RLS) policies are set up in Supabase for the note_images table and the storage bucket?

Answer:
Currently, there are no explicit RLS policies defined for the note_images table or storage bucket.

Question:
Is the working app using the Supabase client directly for uploading or is it going through a server-side API?

Answer:
The app is using the Supabase client directly for both storage operations and database operations. Here's how it works:

For image uploads:

const { data: uploadData, error: uploadError } = await supabase.storage
  .from('note-images')
  .upload(filePath, blob, {
    contentType: mimeType,
    cacheControl: '3600'
  });
For getting public URLs:

const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
  .from('note-images')
  .getPublicUrl(filePath);
For image deletion:

const { error: storageError } = await supabase.storage
  .from('note-images')
  .remove([image.storage_path]);
The app is using the client-side Supabase SDK directly without an intermediary server-side API. All storage operations are performed directly from the browser, with security being handled by Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policies and storage bucket policies.

The only server-side component is the Edge Function for image optimization (supabase/functions/optimize-image/index.ts), but this is used for processing images before storage, not for the actual storage operations.

Question:
What's the exact structure of the storage_path being used in the working app?

Answer:
the storage_path structure is:


images/${filename}
where filename is generated as:


const filename = `${crypto.randomUUID()}.jpg`;
const filePath = `images/${filename}`;
So the complete structure is:

A root folder called "images"
Inside it, files named with a UUID followed by .jpg extension
Example: images/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000.jpg
This structure is used consistently throughout the application for both:

Storing images: When uploading to the 'note-images' bucket
Database references: The storage_path column in the note_images table stores this exact path
The path is always relative to the root of the storage bucket, so when used with Supabase storage operations, it's always referenced from the 'note-images' bucket root.

Question:
What user authentication method is being used for storage access?

Answer:
The app uses Supabase's built-in JWT token authentication for storage access.

The authentication flow works as follows:

When a user signs in, Supabase automatically handles the JWT token generation
The token is stored in localStorage (configured in the Supabase client setup)
All storage operations automatically use this token for authentication through the Supabase client:

// From src/lib/supabase.ts
export const supabase = createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true,
    flowType: 'pkce',
    storage: localStorage
  }
});
This means:

No separate authentication is needed for storage operations
The same JWT token used for database access is used for storage access
Token refresh is handled automatically by the Supabase client
Storage permissions are enforced through Supabase's RLS policies
The storage access is tied directly to the user's authentication state - if they're not authenticated, they won't have access to storage operations.
