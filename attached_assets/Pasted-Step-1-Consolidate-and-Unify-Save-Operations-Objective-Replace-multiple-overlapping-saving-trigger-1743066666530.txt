Step 1: Consolidate and Unify Save Operations
Objective:
Replace multiple overlapping saving triggers with a single unified save queue that batches changes into one atomic transaction.

Actions:

Create a unified save function that debounces rapid user inputs.

Ensure that any new user activity cancels a pending save to avoid overlapping operations.

Self-Test:

Simulate rapid edits and verify that the system processes all changes in one transaction without partial updates.

Step 2: Embrace Optimistic UI Updates with Immediate Reconciliation
Objective:
Ensure the UI reflects changes immediately (optimistic update) and then reconciles with the confirmed database state.

Actions:

Implement optimistic UI updates as soon as a user edits data.

Develop a reconciliation mechanism that adjusts the UI if the background save fails or differs from the database.

Self-Test:

Edit data and observe immediate UI changes.

Simulate a partial save failure and check that the UI displays an error or automatically retries/reconciles.

Step 3: Simplify Timer and Event Handling
Objective:
Reduce complexity by using one debounced auto-save function instead of separate timers (5-second inactivity and 800ms blur).

Actions:

Refactor the code to have a single debounced auto-save handler that listens to both inactivity and blur events.

Ensure the new handler cancels any pending saves on further user interaction.

Self-Test:

Verify that rapid focus switches or typing do not trigger multiple save operations.

Confirm that only one save occurs after the user stops interacting.

Step 4: Enhance Conflict Resolution
Objective:
Ensure that save operations are atomic to prevent partial updates and data inconsistency.

Actions:

Wrap save logic into an atomic transaction so that either all changes are committed or none are.

Add robust error detection and retry mechanisms for failed save operations.

Self-Test:

Force a failure on one part of the data save and verify that the entire save either rolls back or retries without losing user edits.

Step 5: Advance Real-Time Data Propagation
Objective:
Improve the instantaneous update of UI elements when the database changes.

Actions:

Integrate real-time listeners (e.g., via WebSockets or another real-time data service) to instantly propagate database changes to the UI.

Ensure all connected components refresh immediately when updates occur.

Self-Test:

Confirm that any change in the database is immediately reflected in the UI without manual refresh.

Step 6: Finalize and Enhance Background Synchronization
Objective:
Complete the offline queue management and service worker logic for full offline support and reliable background sync.

Actions:

Fully implement IndexedDB operations to queue, execute, and clear pending offline operations.

Enhance the service worker to correctly process offline operations upon reconnection and ensure they are executed in order.

Self-Test:

Simulate an offline scenario: make several changes while offline, then reconnect, and verify that all pending operations are executed correctly and in order.
